          Internet of things (IoT) devices were heterogeneous, commonly with vendor-specific protocols, designs and implementations for device access, communication, and security. The IoT ecosystem's heterogeneous nature has posed fundamental challenges for consumer usability and device security. In response, industry–unifying standards for IoT design and implementation have emerged. For example, Matter is an emerging standard for smart home and IoT (Internet of Things) devices. The Matter open-source design and implementation are being contributed across the IoT industry and increasingly adopted into real-world IoT products.
          <br><br>
          Any security and privacy problems in standardized IoT practices can be easily inherited by real IoT products of many manufacturers. The vision of the workshop is to shift the research focus and consider the foundational role of IoT design standards and their open-source implementation in facilitating IoT development and protecting the security and trustworthiness of security-critical IoT infrastructures and systems. The IoT standard and open-source community are expected to integrate and implement practical and rigorous security/privacy measures to ensure the standardized practices are soundly designed and implemented.
          <br><br>
          We invite researchers and practitioners to submit original research papers for the first workshop on Security and Privacy in Standardized IoT (SDIoTSec 2024). The aim of this workshop is to bring together experts from academia and industry to discuss and address security and privacy challenges posed by standardizing IoT design and implementation and their real-world deployments. The expected impacts include significantly eliminating security and privacy threats in both the design and implementation space of IoT.

        <h1>Scope and Topics of Interest</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 1.3rem">
            The research should be related to emerging IoT standards (such as Matter), or common/standardized IoT design and implementation (``common’’ means shared). The research is related to security, privacy, safety, and governance of IoT systems. 
            <br><br>
            Specific topics of interests include but are not limited to the following:
            <ul style="font-size: 1.3rem">
                <li>Novel attacks</li>
                <li>Privacy-enhancing techniques</li>
                <li>Problems related to heterogeneous IoT design and practices</li>
                <li>Formal methods to find attack vectors or for defense </li>
                <li>AI/ML/NLP based methods for analysis of specifications</li>
                <li>Program analysis on implementation of Matter, or other standard implementation of IoT systems</li>
                <li>End-user facing problems</li>
                <li>Problems in real-world adoption of IoT-standard design and implementations</li>
                <li>Policies or governance issues related to Matter or emerging IoT standards.</li>
                <li>Surveillance and censorship related to Matter or emerging IoT standards</li>
                <li>Anonymity and pseudonymity related to Matter or emerging IoT standards </li>
                <li>Case studies and real-world experience related to Matter or emerging IoT standards</li>

        <h1>Submission Instructions</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 1.3rem">

            Submitted papers must be in English, unpublished, and must not be currently under review for any other publication. Submissions must be a PDF file in double-column NDSS format (see <a href="https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2024/submissions/templates/">NDSS Proceedings Template</a>). We accept (1) regular papers with up to 8 pages, (2) short papers or work-in-progress papers with up to 4 pages. The page limits does not include bibliography and well-marked appendices, which can be up to 2 pages long. Note that reviewers are not required to read the appendices or any supplementary material. Authors should not change the font or the margins of the NDSS format. The review process is double-blind. All papers must be in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) and submitted through the web submission form via Hotcrp (link will come soon).

        <p style="font-size: 1.3rem">

            All papers will be published by the Internet Society. At least one author of each accepted submission will register and present at the workshop. Authors are responsible for obtaining appropriate publication clearances. We are expecting to hold an in person conference and that authors will be able to travel to the conference to present their paper, but will make allowances for remote presentation in cases where all authors of a paper have legitimate reasons they are unable to attend in person.
